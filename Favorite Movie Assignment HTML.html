	<h1> Why Interstellar is My Favorite Movie </h1>
	<p> This is my favorite movie for many reasons. I was first introduced to the movie when I won first place in state-wide in the science olympiad event Reach for the Stars, 
where I received a copy of the book The Science of Interstellar, autographed by renowned physicist and author Kip Thorne. I was awed by watching the movie. But more importantly, 
I was even more awed after reading the book. I was amazed at all the science behind it, all the effort Kip Thorne and the team to make sure everything was scientifically sound.
I learned a lot from both the book and the movie, and to me it is a monument of astrophysics and theoretical physics in popular culture. <p>

	<h1> My Favorite Actor/Actress </h1>
	<p> I don't watch movies very often, so I don't really have a favorite actor or actress. However, I think Mackenzie Foy was really good at acting the young Murph, crying at her father going away to save humanity, possibly never to come back. <p>
